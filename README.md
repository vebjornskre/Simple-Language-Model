# Simple-Language-Model
Three models - a word embedding model, a be/have conjugation model, and a text generation model

We have three notebooks and one utlis python script in this porject. You should have all these files in the same folder.
To run correctly you need to generata a folder called "generated", and inside this folder, there should be three folders
"conjugation", "text_generation" and "word_embeddings". These store the different objects created in each task. The order to run is:

1. Run word_embeddings.ipynb
2. Run conjugation.ipynb
3. Run text_generation.ipynb

"utils.py" should not be ran, but is imported in all three notebooks.

Authors of this project was Vebjørn Sæten Skre and Marin Flo Øfstaas
